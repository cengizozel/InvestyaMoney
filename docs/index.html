        <h3>("The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing" by Benjamin Graham)</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="a"><ul>

        <h3>Intro</h3>

        <li>
            Three main takeaways:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    "how you can minimize the odds of suffering irreversible losses"
                </li>
                <li>
                    "how you can maximize the chances of achieving sustainable gains"
                </li>
                <li>
                    "how you can control the self-defeating behavior that keeps most investors from reaching their full potential" (12).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            "The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists" (xii).
        </li>

        <li>
            "In our own stock-market experienceand observation, extending over 50 years, 
            we have not known a single person who has consistently or 
            lastingly made money by thus 'following the market'" (3).
        </li>

        <li>
            Two types of investors:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Defensive (passive) investor: "...emphasis on the avoidance of serious mistakes or losses.
                    His second aim will be freedom from effort, annoyance, and the need for making frequent decisions" (6).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enterprising (active/aggressive) investor: "...devote time and care to the selection of securities that are both
                    sound and more attractive than the average" (6).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            "It has long been the prevalent view that the art of successful investment 
            lies first in the choice of those industries that are most likely to grow in the 
            future and then in identifying the most promising companies in these industries" (6).
        </li>

        <li>
            Two morals:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    "Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not
                    translate into obvious profits for investors" (7).
                </li>
                <li>
                    "The experts do not have dependable ways of selecting and concentrating 
                    on the most promising companies in the most promising industries" (7).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            "The habit of relating what is paid to what is being offered is an invaluable trait in investment" (8).
        </li>

        <h3>Investment versus Speculation</h3>

        <li>
            "An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis 
            promises safety of principal and an adequate return. 
            Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative" (18).
        </li>

        <li>
            "Outright speculation is
            neither illegal, immoral, nor (for most people) fattening to the
            pocketbook. More than that, some speculation is necessary and
            unavoidable, for in many common-stock situations there are substantial possibilities of both profit and loss, and the risks therein
            must be assumed by someone" (21).
        </li>

        <li>
            There is intelligent speculation as
            there is intelligent investing:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    speculating when you think you are investing
                </li>
                <li>
                    speculating seriously instead of as a pastime, 
                    when you lack proper knowledge and skill for it
                </li>
                <li>
                    risking more money in speculation than you can afford to lose (21).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            "And everyone who buys a
            so-called “hot” common-stock issue, or makes a purchase in any
            way similar thereto, is either speculating or gambling."
        </li>

        <li>
            "If you want to try your luck at it, put aside a portion—
            the smaller the better—of your capital in a separate fund for this
            purpose. Never add more money to this account just because the 
            market has gone up and profits are rolling in. (That’s the time to
            think of taking money out of your speculative fund.)"
        </li>

        <li>
            "Never mingle
            your speculative and investment operations in the same account,
            nor in any part of your thinking" (22).
        </li>

        <li>
            Results to Be Expected by the Defensive Investor
            <ol>
                <li>
                    "the interest and principal payments on good bonds
                    are much better protected and therefore more certain 
                    than the dividends and price appreciation
                     on stocks...bond investment appears clearly 
                     preferable to stock investment" (26).
                </li>
                <li>
                    "But of course we cannot be certain that bonds 
                    will work out better than stocks from today’s levels" (26).
                </li>
                <li>
                    "The defensive
                    investor must confine himself to the shares of important companies
                    with a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial
                    condition" (28).
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 - "purchase of the shares of well-established investment funds as an
                    alternative to creating his own common-stock portfolio"
                </li>

                <li>
                    2 - "utilize one of the “common trust funds,” or “commingled
                    funds,” operated by trust companies and banks in many states; or,
                    if his funds are substantial, use the services of a recognized 
                    investment-counsel firm"...“formula investing” (29).
                </li>

                <li>
                    3 - "“dollar-cost averaging,” which means simply that the
                    practitioner invests in common stocks the same number of dollars
                    each month or each quarter"
                </li>
            </ol>
