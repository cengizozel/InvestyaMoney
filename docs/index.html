    <h2>Book Notes</h2>
    <h3>("The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing" by Benjamin Graham)</h3>

    <div class="a"><ul>

        <h3>Intro</h3>

        <li>
            Three main takeaways:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    "how you can minimize the odds of suffering irreversible losses"
                </li>
                <li>
                    "how you can maximize the chances of achieving sustainable gains"
                </li>
                <li>
                    "how you can control the self-defeating behavior that keeps most investors from reaching their full potential" (12).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            "The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists" (xii).
        </li>

        <li>
            "In our own stock-market experienceand observation, extending over 50 years, 
            we have not known a single person who has consistently or 
            lastingly made money by thus 'following the market'" (3).
        </li>

        <li>
            Two types of investors:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Defensive (passive) investor: "...emphasis on the avoidance of serious mistakes or losses.
                    His second aim will be freedom from effort, annoyance, and the need for making frequent decisions" (6).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enterprising (active/aggressive) investor: "...devote time and care to the selection of securities that are both
                    sound and more attractive than the average" (6).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            "It has long been the prevalent view that the art of successful investment 
            lies first in the choice of those industries that are most likely to grow in the 
            future and then in identifying the most promising companies in these industries" (6).
        </li>

        <li>
            Two morals:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    "Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not
                    translate into obvious profits for investors" (7).
                </li>
                <li>
                    "The experts do not have dependable ways of selecting and concentrating 
                    on the most promising companies in the most promising industries" (7).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            "The habit of relating what is paid to what is being offered is an invaluable trait in investment" (8).
        </li>

        <h3>Investment versus Speculation</h3>

        <li>
            "An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis 
            promises safety of principal and an adequate return. 
            Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative" (18).
        </li>

        <li>
            "Outright speculation is
            neither illegal, immoral, nor (for most people) fattening to the
            pocketbook. More than that, some speculation is necessary and
            unavoidable, for in many common-stock situations there are substantial possibilities of both profit and loss, and the risks therein
            must be assumed by someone" (21).
        </li>

        <li>
            There is intelligent speculation as
            there is intelligent investing:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    speculating when you think you are investing
                </li>
                <li>
                    speculating seriously instead of as a pastime, 
                    when you lack proper knowledge and skill for it
                </li>
                <li>
                    risking more money in speculation than you can afford to lose (21).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            "And everyone who buys a
            so-called “hot” common-stock issue, or makes a purchase in any
            way similar thereto, is either speculating or gambling."
        </li>

        <li>
            "If you want to try your luck at it, put aside a portion—
            the smaller the better—of your capital in a separate fund for this
            purpose. Never add more money to this account just because the 
            market has gone up and profits are rolling in. (That’s the time to
            think of taking money out of your speculative fund.)"
        </li>

        <li>
            "Never mingle
            your speculative and investment operations in the same account,
            nor in any part of your thinking" (22).
        </li>

        <li>
            Results to Be Expected by the Defensive Investor
            <ol>
                <li>
                    "the interest and principal payments on good bonds
                    are much better protected and therefore more certain 
                    than the dividends and price appreciation
                     on stocks...bond investment appears clearly 
                     preferable to stock investment" (26).
                </li>
                <li>
                    "But of course we cannot be certain that bonds 
                    will work out better than stocks from today’s levels" (26).
                </li>
                <li>
                    "The defensive
                    investor must confine himself to the shares of important companies
                    with a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial
                    condition" (28).

                    1 - "purchase of the shares of well-established investment funds as an
                    alternative to creating his own common-stock portfolio"

                    funds,” operated by trust companies and banks in many states; or,

                    investment-counsel firm"...“formula investing” (29).

                investor start with a clear conception as to 
                which courses of action offer reasonable chances 
                of success and which do not" (30).

            General Approach</h3>

        <li>
             "Which factors determine how much you should be willing to pay for a
             stock? What makes one company worth 10 times earnings and
             another worth 20 times? How can you be reasonably sure that you are
             not overpaying for an apparently rosy future that turns out to be a
             murky nightmare?
             Graham feels that five elements are decisive.1 He summarizes them as:
             • the company’s “general long-term prospects”
             • the quality of its management
             • its financial strength and capital structure
             • its dividend record

            the income statements, you can see whether revenues and net
            earnings have grown smoothly and steadily over the previous 10
            years. A recent article in the Financial Analysts Journal confirmed
            what other studies (and the sad experience of many investors)
            have shown: that the fastest-growing companies tend to overheat
            and flame out.6 If earnings are growing at a long-term rate of 10%
            pretax (or 6% to 7% after-tax), that may be sustainable. But the
            15% growth hurdle that many companies set for themselves is
            delusional. And an even higher rate—or a sudden burst of growth
            in one or two years—is all but certain to fade, just like an inexperienced marathoner who tries to run the whole race as if it were a

        <li>
            "This chapter will begin with two pieces of advice to the investor
            that cannot avoid being contradictory in their implications. The
            first is: Don’t take a single year’s earnings seriously. The second is:
            If you do pay attention to short-term earnings, look out for booby
            traps in the per-share figures" (310).
        </li>

        <li>
            "A few pointers will help you avoid buying a stock that turns out to be
            an accounting time bomb:
            Read backwards. When you research a company’s financial
            reports, start reading on the last page and slowly work your way
            toward the front. Anything that the company doesn’t want you to find
            is buried in the back—which is precisely why you should look there
            first.
            Read the notes. Never buy a stock without reading the footnotes
            to the financial statements in the annual report. Usually labeled “summary of significant accounting policies,” one key note describes how
            the company recognizes revenue, records inventories, treats installment or contract sales, expenses its marketing costs, and accounts
            for the other major aspects of its business" (328).
        </li>

        <li>
            "If you are an enterprising investor willing to put plenty
            of time and energy into your portfolio, then you owe it to yourself to
            learn more about financial reporting. That’s the only way to minimize
            your odds of being misled by a shifty earnings statement. Three solid
            books full of timely and specific examples are Martin Fridson and Fernando Alvarez’s Financial Statement Analysis, Charles Mulford and
            Eugene Comiskey’s The Financial Numbers Game, and Howard

            outlook, the shares have appeal for the long term....A continued acquisition policy together with a strong position in industrial fields and an
            accelerated international program suggests further sales and earnings
            progress.”

            under the heading of quality. The second, or protective, approach
            may be called the quantitative or statistical approach, since it

            earnings, assets, dividends, and so forth" (365).

            "A low-cost index fund is the best tool ever created for low-maintenance stock investing—and

            higher costs) than a truly defensive investor can justify" (367).

        <li>
            "Researching and selecting your own stocks is not necessary; for
            most people, it is not even advisable. However, some defensive
            investors do enjoy the diversion and intellectual challenge of picking
            individual stocks—and, if you have survived a bear market and still
            enjoy stock picking, then nothing that Graham or I could say will dissuade you. In that case, instead of making a total stock market index
            fund your complete portfolio, make it the foundation of your portfolio.
            Once you have that foundation in place, you can experiment around
            the edges with your own stock choices. Keep 90% of your stock
            money in an index fund, leaving 10% with which to try picking your
            own stocks. Only after you build that solid core should you explore" (367).

            their current liabilities, and whose long-term debt does not exceed
            working capital, you should end up with a group of conservatively
            financed companies with plenty of staying power. The best values

            gone cold" (371).

            three years...Graham recommends a “ratio of price to assets”

            "What about Graham’s suggestion that you multiply the P/E ratio by
            the price-to-book ratio and see whether the resulting number is below
            22.5? Based on data from Morgan Stanley, at least 142 stocks in the
            S & P 500 could pass that test as of early 2003, including Dana
            Corp., Electronic Data Systems, Sun Microsystems, and Washington

            It is worth remarking that the S & P rankings showed
            up very well in this single test. In every case a portfolio based on a
            higher ranking did better than a lower-ranking portfolio. (2) Companies

            well as a whole in the 2 1⁄2-year holding period. (By “good-will

            up...looking at the daily list of new 52-week lows in the Wall Street Journal or the
            similar table in the “Market Week” section of Barron’s. That will point
            you toward stocks and industries that are unfashionable or unloved
            and that thus offer the potential for high returns once perceptions
            change" (397).

            "By separately analyzing each of the company’s divisions this way,
            you may be able to see whether they are worth more than the current
            stock price. Longleaf’s Hawkins likes to find what he calls “60-cent
            dollars,” or companies whose stock is trading at 60% or less of the
            value at which he appraises the businesses" (399). -read full page again

        <h3>Convertible Issues and Warrants</h3>

        <li>
            "Let us talk in concrete terms. You buy a 6% bond at 100, convertible 
            into stock at 25—that is, at the rate of 40 shares for each $1,000
            bond. The stock goes to 30, which makes the bond worth at least
            120, and so it sells at 125. You either sell or hold. If you hold, 
            hoping for a higher price, you are pretty much in the position of a 
            common shareholder, since if the stock goes down your bond will go
            down too. A conservative person is likely to say that beyond 125
            his position has become too speculative, and therefore he sells and
            makes a gratifying 25% profit" (407).
        </li>

        <li>
            "If you own a convertible, you also hold an option: You can either
            keep the bond and continue to earn interest on it, or you can
            exchange it for common stock of the issuing company at a predetermined ratio" (418).
        </li>

        <li>
            "From 1957 through 2002, according to Ibbotson Associates, convertible bonds earned an annual average return of 8.3%—only two percentage points below the total return on stocks, but with steadier
            prices and shallower losses.2 More income, less risk than stocks: No
            wonder Wall Street’s salespeople often describe convertibles as a
            “best of both worlds” investment. But the intelligent investor will
            quickly realize that convertibles offer less income and more risk than
            most other bonds. So they could, by the same logic and with equal
            justice, be called a “worst of both worlds” investment. Which side you
            come down on depends on how you use them" (419).
        </li>

        <li>
            "It’s expensive to trade small lots of convertible bonds, and diversification is impractical unless you have well over $100,000 to invest in
            this sector alone" (420).

        <h3>Four Extremely Instructive Case Histories</h3>

        <li>
            "The four companies to be reviewed, and the different
            extremes that they illustrate are:
            <br>Penn Central (Railroad) Co. An extreme example of the neglect of
            the most elementary warning signals of financial weakness, by all
            those who had bonds or shares of this system under their supervision. A crazily high market price for the stock of a tottering giant.
            <br>Ling-Temco-Vought Inc. An extreme example of quick and
            unsound “empire building,” with ultimate collapse practically
            guaranteed; but helped by indiscriminate bank lending.
            <br>NVF Corp. An extreme example of one corporate acquisition, in
            which a small company absorbed another seven times its size,
            incurring a huge debt and employing some startling accounting
            devices.
            <br>AAA Enterprises. An extreme example of public stock-financing
            of a small company; its value based on the magic word “franchising,” and little else, sponsored by important stock-exchange
            houses. Bankruptcy followed within two years of the stock sale
            and the doubling of the initial inflated price in the heedless stock
            market" (422).

        <h3>A Comparison of Eight Pairs of Companies</h3>

        <li>
            "The cheap stocks may later become overpriced; the expensive stocks may turn cheap. At some point in its life,
            almost every stock is a bargain; at another time, it will be expensive.
            Although there are good and bad companies, there is no such thing as
            a good stock; there are only good stock prices, which come and go" (473).
        </li>

        <li>
            "It’s well established that people often assign a mental value to
            stocks based largely on the emotional imagery that companies evoke.1
            But the intelligent investor always digs deeper" (474).
        </li>

        <li>
            "The market scoffs at Graham’s principles
            in the short run, but they are always revalidated in the end. If you buy a
            stock purely because its price has been going up—instead of asking
            whether the underlying company’s value is increasing—then sooner or
            later you will be extremely sorry. That’s not a likelihood. 
            It is a certainty" (486).

        <h3>Shareholders and Managements:
            Dividend Policy</h3>

        <li>
            "It is important that investors understand the essential difference
            between a stock dividend (properly so-called) and a stock split.
            The latter represents a restatement of the common-stock structure—in 
            a typical case by issuing two or three shares for one. The new shares 
            are not related to specific earnings reinvested in a specific past period" (492).
        </li>

        <li>
            "Graham wants you to realize something basic but incredibly profound: 
            When you buy a stock, you become an owner of the company.
            Its managers, all the way up to the CEO, work for you. Its board of
            directors must answer to you. Its cash belongs to you. Its businesses
            are your property. If you don’t like how your company is being managed, 
            you have the right to demand that the managers be fired, the
            directors be changed, or the property be sold. “Stockholders,”
            declares Graham, "should wake up"" (498).
        </li>

        <li>
            "Never dig so deep into the numbers that you check your common sense at
            the door, and always read the proxy statement before (and after)
            you buy a stock" (501).
        </li>

        <li>
            "Research by money managers Robert Arnott and Clifford Asness
            found that when current dividends are low, future corporate earnings also turn out to be low. And when current dividends are high,
            so are future earnings" (506).
        </li>

        <li>
            "Reading proxy statements vigilantly, the intelligent owner will vote
            against any executive compensation plan that uses option grants to
            turn more than 3% of the company’s shares outstanding over to the
            managers...No CEO ever deserves to make himself rich if he
            has produced poor results for you" (510).
        </li>

        <h3>“Margin of Safety” as the
            Central Concept of Investment</h3>

        <li>
            "the
            policy of investing in representative common stocks does not
            require high qualities of insight and foresight to work out successfully. If the purchases are made at the average level of the market
            over a span of years, the prices paid should carry with them assurance of an adequate margin of safety. The danger to investors lies
            in concentrating their purchases in the upper levels of the market,
            or in buying nonrepresentative common stocks that carry more
            than average risk of diminished earning power" (515).
        </li>

        <li>
            "There is a close logical connection between the concept of a
            safety margin and the principle of diversification. One is correlative with the other. Even with a margin in the investor’s favor, an
            individual security may work out badly. For the margin guarantees
            only that he has a better chance for profit than for loss—not that
            loss is impossible. But as the number of such commitments is
            increased the more certain does it become that the aggregate of the
            profits will exceed the aggregate of the losses. That is the simple
            basis of the insurance-underwriting business" (518).
        </li>

        <li>
            Diversification is an established tenet of conservative investment. By accepting it so universally, investors are really demonstrating their acceptance of the margin-of-safety principle, to which
            diversification is the companion" (518).

        <li>
            "Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike...
            The first and most obvious of these principles is, “Know what
            you are doing—know your business...
            A second business principle: “Do not let anyone else run your
            business, unless (1) you can supervise his performance with 
            adequate care and comprehension or (2) you have unusually 
            strong reasons for placing implicit confidence in his 
            integrity and ability...
            A third business principle: “Do not enter upon an operation—
            that is, manufacturing or trading in an item—unless a reliable 
            calculation shows that it has a fair chance to yield a reasonable 
            profit...A fourth business rule is more positive: “Have the courage of
            your knowledge and experience. If you have formed a conclusion
            from the facts and if you know your judgment is sound, act on it—
            even though others may hesitate or differ." (523).

        <li>
            "To achieve satisfactory investment results is easier
            than most people realize; to achieve superior results is harder than it

        <li>
            "Losing some money is an inevitable part of investing, and there’s 
            nothing you can do to prevent it. But, to be an intelligent investor, you must
            take responsibility for ensuring that you never lose most or all of your
            money" (526).

        <li>
            "By refusing to pay too much for an investment, you minimize the

        <li>
            "As you look at yourself in the mirror, what should you watch for?
            The Nobel-prize–winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman explains two
            factors that characterize good decisions:
            • “well-calibrated confidence” (do I understand this investment as
            well as I think I do?)
            • “correctly-anticipated regret” (how will I react if my analysis
            turns out to be wrong?)" (528).

        <li>
            "Simply by keeping your holdings permanently diversified, and refusing to fling money at Mr. Market’s latest, craziest fashions, you can
            ensure that the consequences of your mistakes will never be catastrophic. No matter what Mr. Market throws at you, you will always be
            able to say, with a quiet confidence, “This, too, shall pass away”" (531).
