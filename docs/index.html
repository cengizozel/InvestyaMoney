        I will start organizing this website once I have enough content (should be by Jan 15th).<br>
        Most information here so far is based on the book 
        "The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing" by Benjamin Graham.

    <div class="a"><ul>

        <li>
            Three main takeaways:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    "how you can minimize the odds of suffering irreversible losses"
                </li>
                <li>
                    "how you can maximize the chances of achieving sustainable gains"
                </li>
                <li>
                    "how you can control the self-defeating behavior that keeps most investors from reaching their full potential" (12).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            "The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists" (xii).
        </li>

        <li>
            "In our own stock-market experienceand observation, extending over 50 years, 
            we have not known a single person who has consistently or 
            lastingly made money by thus 'following the market'" (3).
        </li>

        <li>
            Two types of investors:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Defensive (passive) investor: "...emphasis on the avoidance of serious mistakes or losses.
                    His second aim will be freedom from effort, annoyance, and the need for making frequent decisions" (6).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enterprising (active/aggressive) investor: "...devote time and care to the selection of securities that are both
                    sound and more attractive than the average" (6).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            "It has long been the prevalent view that the art of successful investment 
            lies first in the choice of those industries that are most likely to grow in the 
            future and then in identifying the most promising companies in these industries" (6).
        </li>

        <li>
            Two morals:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    "Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not
                    translate into obvious profits for investors" (7).
                </li>
                <li>
                    "The experts do not have dependable ways of selecting and concentrating 
                    on the most promising companies in the most promising industries" (7).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            "The habit of relating what is paid to what is being offered is an invaluable trait in investment" (8).
        </li>

        <li>
            
        </li>
