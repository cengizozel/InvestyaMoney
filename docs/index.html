    <h2>Book Notes</h2>
    <h3>("The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing" by Benjamin Graham)</h3>

    <div class="a"><ul>

        <h3>Intro</h3>

        <li>
            Three main takeaways:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    "how you can minimize the odds of suffering irreversible losses"
                </li>
                <li>
                    "how you can maximize the chances of achieving sustainable gains"
                </li>
                <li>
                    "how you can control the self-defeating behavior that keeps most investors from reaching their full potential" (12).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            "The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists" (xii).
        </li>

        <li>
            "In our own stock-market experienceand observation, extending over 50 years, 
            we have not known a single person who has consistently or 
            lastingly made money by thus 'following the market'" (3).
        </li>

        <li>
            Two types of investors:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Defensive (passive) investor: "...emphasis on the avoidance of serious mistakes or losses.
                    His second aim will be freedom from effort, annoyance, and the need for making frequent decisions" (6).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enterprising (active/aggressive) investor: "...devote time and care to the selection of securities that are both
                    sound and more attractive than the average" (6).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            "It has long been the prevalent view that the art of successful investment 
            lies first in the choice of those industries that are most likely to grow in the 
            future and then in identifying the most promising companies in these industries" (6).
        </li>

        <li>
            Two morals:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    "Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not
                    translate into obvious profits for investors" (7).
                </li>
                <li>
                    "The experts do not have dependable ways of selecting and concentrating 
                    on the most promising companies in the most promising industries" (7).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            "The habit of relating what is paid to what is being offered is an invaluable trait in investment" (8).
        </li>

        <h3>Investment versus Speculation</h3>

        <li>
            "An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis 
            promises safety of principal and an adequate return. 
            Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative" (18).
        </li>

        <li>
            "Outright speculation is
            neither illegal, immoral, nor (for most people) fattening to the
            pocketbook. More than that, some speculation is necessary and
            unavoidable, for in many common-stock situations there are substantial possibilities of both profit and loss, and the risks therein
            must be assumed by someone" (21).
        </li>

        <li>
            There is intelligent speculation as
            there is intelligent investing:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    speculating when you think you are investing
                </li>
                <li>
                    speculating seriously instead of as a pastime, 
                    when you lack proper knowledge and skill for it
                </li>
                <li>
                    risking more money in speculation than you can afford to lose (21).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            "And everyone who buys a
            so-called “hot” common-stock issue, or makes a purchase in any
            way similar thereto, is either speculating or gambling."
        </li>

        <li>
            "If you want to try your luck at it, put aside a portion—
            the smaller the better—of your capital in a separate fund for this
            purpose. Never add more money to this account just because the 
            market has gone up and profits are rolling in. (That’s the time to
            think of taking money out of your speculative fund.)"
        </li>

        <li>
            "Never mingle
            your speculative and investment operations in the same account,
            nor in any part of your thinking" (22).
        </li>

        <li>
            Results to Be Expected by the Defensive Investor
            <ol>
                <li>
                    "the interest and principal payments on good bonds
                    are much better protected and therefore more certain 
                    than the dividends and price appreciation
                     on stocks...bond investment appears clearly 
                     preferable to stock investment" (26).
                </li>
                <li>
                    "But of course we cannot be certain that bonds 
                    will work out better than stocks from today’s levels" (26).
                </li>
                <li>
                    "The defensive
                    investor must confine himself to the shares of important companies
                    with a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial
                    condition" (28).
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 - "purchase of the shares of well-established investment funds as an
                    alternative to creating his own common-stock portfolio"
                </li>

                <li>
                    2 - "utilize one of the “common trust funds,” or “commingled
                    funds,” operated by trust companies and banks in many states; or,
                    if his funds are substantial, use the services of a recognized 
                    investment-counsel firm"...“formula investing” (29).
                </li>

                <li>
                    3 - "“dollar-cost averaging,” which means simply that the
                    practitioner invests in common stocks the same number of dollars
                    each month or each quarter"

                investor start with a clear conception as to 
                which courses of action offer reasonable chances 
                of success and which do not" (30).

                    you must thoroughly analyze a company, and the soundness

            the short run, your returns will always be hostage to Mr. Market and
            his whims. But you can control:
            • your brokerage costs, by trading rarely, patiently, and cheaply
            • your ownership costs, by refusing to buy mutual funds with
            excessive annual expenses
            • your expectations, by using realism, not fantasy, to forecast your
            returns7
            • your risk, by deciding how much of your total assets to put at
            hazard in the stock market, by diversifying, and by rebalancing
            • your tax bills, by holding stocks for at least one year and, whenever possible, for at least five years, to lower your capital-gains liability
            • and, most of all, your own behavior" (219).

            the average individual who put his money exclusively in 
            investment-fund shares in the past ten years has fared 
            better than the average person who made his common-stock

            "So when should you sell[a fund]? Here a few definite red flags:
            • a sharp and unexpected change in strategy, such as a “value”
            fund loading up on technology stocks in 1999 or a “growth” fund
            buying tons of insurance stocks in 2002;
            • an increase in expenses, suggesting that the managers are lining their own pockets;
            • large and frequent tax bills generated by excessive trading;
            • suddenly erratic returns, as when a formerly conservative fund
            generates a big loss (or even produces a giant gain)" (254).

            "Advice on investments may be obtained from a variety of
            sources. These include: (1) a relative or friend, presumably 
            knowledgeable in securities; (2) a local (commercial) banker; 
            (3) a brokerage firm or investment banking house; (4) a 
            financial service or periodical; and (5) an investment counselor" (258).

            "An important step was taken in 1963 toward giving professional
            standing and responsibility to financial analysts. The official title of
            chartered financial analyst (CFA) is now awarded to those senior
            practitioners who pass required examinations and meet other tests
            of fitness.1 The subjects covered include security analysis and portfolio management. The analogy with the long-established professional title of certified public accountant (CPA) is evident and
            intentional. This relatively new apparatus of recognition and control should serve to elevate the standards of financial analysts and
            eventually to place their work on a truly professional basis" (265).

        <h3>Security Analysis for the Lay Investor:
            General Approach</h3>

        <li>
             "Which factors determine how much you should be willing to pay for a
             stock? What makes one company worth 10 times earnings and
             another worth 20 times? How can you be reasonably sure that you are
             not overpaying for an apparently rosy future that turns out to be a
             murky nightmare?
             Graham feels that five elements are decisive.1 He summarizes them as:
             • the company’s “general long-term prospects”
             • the quality of its management
             • its financial strength and capital structure
             • its dividend record
             • and its current dividend rate" (302).

        <li>
            "The long-term prospects. Nowadays, the intelligent investor
            should begin by downloading at least five years’ worth of annual
            reports (Form 10-K) from the company’s website or from the EDGAR
            database at www.sec.gov" (302).

            "The company is a marathoner, not a sprinter. By looking back at
            the income statements, you can see whether revenues and net
            earnings have grown smoothly and steadily over the previous 10
            years. A recent article in the Financial Analysts Journal confirmed
            what other studies (and the sad experience of many investors)
            have shown: that the fastest-growing companies tend to overheat
            and flame out.6 If earnings are growing at a long-term rate of 10%
            pretax (or 6% to 7% after-tax), that may be sustainable. But the
            15% growth hurdle that many companies set for themselves is
            delusional. And an even higher rate—or a sudden burst of growth
            in one or two years—is all but certain to fade, just like an inexperienced marathoner who tries to run the whole race as if it were a
            100-meter dash" (305).

            annual report. See whether cash from operations has grown steadily

        <li>
            "If owner earnings per share have grown at a steady average of at
            least 6% or 7% over the past 10 years, the company is a stable generator 
            of cash, and its prospects for growth are good" (308).

        <h3>Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings</h3>

        <li>
            "This chapter will begin with two pieces of advice to the investor
            that cannot avoid being contradictory in their implications. The
            first is: Don’t take a single year’s earnings seriously. The second is:
            If you do pay attention to short-term earnings, look out for booby
            traps in the per-share figures" (310).
